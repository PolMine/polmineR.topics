## v0.1.14
  * The preliminary Rmarkdown template to use 'gensim' for topic modelling has been turned into a (somewhat) consolidated Rmarkdown template.
  * Functions `gensim_ldamodel_as_LDA_Gibbs()`, `gensim_ldamodel_load()` and `dtm_as_bow()` were added as functionality to get a gensim LDA model (prepared in Python) back to an R session.
