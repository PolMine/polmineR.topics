# About

Using topic models, an unsupervised learning approach developed for information retrieval, has become common in the humanities and the social sciences. But in this disciplinary context, the methodological relocation of topic modelling requires the development of best practices and tools how validity can be ensured. The **topicanalysis** package offers a toolset to evaluate topic models, and to support validation by offering a nexus between quantitative and qualitative inquiry.
